# real-estate-price-prediction

In this project we aim to take advantage of a machine learning model by making predictions through a web application.

We constructed the model step by step going through all the hooks data scientists usually do building a machine learning model like *data cleaning*, *feature engineering*, *outlier removal* and *training the model*.

We consumed the model through RESTFUL API thanks to a reactjs client.
